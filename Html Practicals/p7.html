            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It forms the backbone of almost every website you visit, providing the structure and content that browsers need to display a webpage. HTML consists of a series of elements, which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets. These elements allow developers to organize text, images, links, and other content into a coherent format that can be interpreted by web browsers. Each HTML document begins with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` tag that encompasses the entire content. Inside the `<html>` tag, there are two main sections: the `<head>` and the `<body>`. The `<head>` section typically contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts, while the `<body>` section includes the actual content visible on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and media. HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language, meaning it doesn't have the logic of programming languages like JavaScript or Python. Instead, it is used to "mark up" content to be displayed on the web. HTML has evolved significantly since its inception, with the current version being HTML5. This version introduced new elements, attributes, and behaviors, as well as improved support for multimedia, graphics, and APIs, making it easier for developers to create rich, interactive web applications. Despite its simplicity, HTML is a powerful tool in the hands of web developers, enabling them to structure content in a way that is both accessible and aesthetically pleasing
